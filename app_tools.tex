\chapter{Tools Used}

Different tools were used in the analysis environment in order to efficiently simulate and analyze the work of this thesis:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The simulation environment is based on \texttt{Python 3.5.2}\foot{https://www.python.org}{06.01.2017} using the \texttt{Anaconda}\foot{https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview}{03.04.2017} platform.
	\item The discrete event simulation environment is implemented by using the \texttt{SimPy 3.0.10}\foot{https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}{06.01.2017} package.
	\item The resulting data is plotted using \texttt{Matplotlib 2.0.0}\foot{http://matplotlib.org/}{03.04.2017}.
	\item \texttt{\glsentrylong{tf} 1.0}\foot{https://www.tensorflow.org/}{03.04.2017} is the library used for the \glspl{ann} modeling.
	\item Coding was done using \texttt{PyCharm 2017.1}\foot{https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/}{03.04.2017} as \gls{ide} for \texttt{Python}.
	\item For solving the \gls{milp} problems for batch policies \texttt{Gurobi 7.0.1}\foot{http://www.gurobi.com}{06.01.2017} was used.
