  abstract     = {Workflow systems provide the key technology to enable business-process automation. One important function of workflow management is role resolution, i.e., the mechanism of assigning tasks to individual workers at runtime according to the role qualification defined in the workflow model. Role-resolution decisions directly affect the productivity of workers in an organization, and consequently affect corporate profitability. Therefore it is important to develop effective policies governing these decisions. However, there has not been a formal treatment of role-resolution policies in the literature. In this paper, we analyze role-resolution policies used in current workflow practice and propose new optimization-based policies that utilize online batching. Through a computational study, we examine three workflow-performance measures including maximum flowtime, average workload, and workload variation under these policies in different business scenarios. These scenarios vary by overall system load, task-processing-time distribution, and the number of workers. Based on computational results, we obtain the following insights that can help guide the selection of role-resolution policies. (a) As the overall system load increases, the benefit of using batching-based online optimization policies becomes more significant. (b) Processing-time variation has a major impact on workflow performance, and higher variation favors optimization-based policies. (c) Online optimization has the potential to reduce average workload significantly, and to reduce workload variation significantly as well.},

Staffing decisions is assigning one more more roles to each user.
Role resolution is assigning a task to an appropriate worker at runtime.
Staffing decisions are usually made offline and periodically and are of strategic nature. If role resolution were to be made online and can be a major operational level decision (strategic vs. operational role)
Workflow role resolution three types: system built-in policies, user customizable policies and rule based policies
Assignment problems when considering capacities of the resources are NP hard.
This paper focuses on how to make assignment and scheduling decisions with considerations of worker's preferences
Five workflow role resolution policies:
1) load balanced approach or simply known as push
2) shared queue policy
3) k batch policy
4)  k batch -1 policy
5) 1 batch 1 policy
Summary key findings:
1) use batching based online optimization policies when system load is medium to high
2) processing time variation has major impact on system performance --> higher variation favors optimization based policies
3) average workload and workload variation can be significantly reduced by online optimization
4) 1-batch-1 onliine optimization policy yields best results in operational conditions.},

Successful business process management depends on effective workflow modeling and analysis. One of the important aspects of workflow analysis is the data-flow perspective because, given a syntactically correct process sequence, errors can still occur during workflow execution due to incorrect data-flow specifications. However, there have been only scant treatments of the data-flow perspective in the literature and no formal methodologies are available for systematically discovering data-flow errors in a workflow model. As an indication of this research gap, existing commercial workflow management systems do not provide tools for data-flow analysis at design time. In this paper, we provide a data-flow perspective for detecting data-flow anomalies such as missing data, redundant data, and potential data conflicts. Our data-flow framework includes two basic components: data-flow specification and data-flow analysis; these components add more analytical rigor to business process management.},

However, maintaining the consistency of workflow models under frequent changes is a significant challenge in the management of corporate information services. Unfortunately, few formal approaches are found in the literature for managing workflow changes systematically. In this paper, we propose an analytical framework for workflow change management through formal modeling of workflow constraints, leading to an approach called Constraint-centric Workflow Change Analytics (CWCA). A core component of \{CWCA\} is the formal definition and analysis of workflow change anomalies. We operationalize \{CWCA\} by developing a change anomaly detection algorithm and validate it in the context of procurement management. A prototype system based on an open-source rule engine is presented to provide a proof-of-concept implementation of CWCA. },

Conceptual models are normally used to document the generic business process requirements in the company. Logical models are generally used for defining technology specific requirements, where software modules as well as their behavioral patterns should be clearly specified. However, the transformation from conceptual models to logical models can be a tedious task, often causing errors in the resulting logical model. In this paper, we propose a formal approach that can be used to support efficient and accurate model transformation. First, we develop a procedure for transforming a conceptual workflow model into its corresponding logical workflow model. Business requirement analysis, dependency mapping, and workflow pattern-based model transformation are the major components of this transformation procedure. Second, we create a validation procedure that can validate whether the derived logical model is consistent with its original conceptual model. Business process ontologies are employed in our approach to describe both conceptual and logical models. We also implement a prototype system and conduct a demonstrative case study to show the feasibility of our approach. },

However, only scant research attention has been paid to formal workflow design methodologies. As a result, existing design methods in business process management remain a manual and experiential effort and result in inefficiency in design tasks and potential errors in workflow models. Considering that there are hundreds and thousands of business processes in organizations worldwide, overcoming this deficiency will have an enormous technical and economic impact on enterprise information management. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of incorporating formal analytics into workflow design, thus alleviating the intellectual challenge faced by business analysts when creating workflow models. The workflow design analytics we propose helps construct a workflow model based on information about the relevant activities and their associated data. In addition, our workflow design approach also helps determine whether the given information is sufficient for generating a workflow model and ensures the avoidance of certain workflow anomalies. The significance of our study is to enable the transformation of workflow design from a manual and experiential effort into a more systematic and rigorous approach.},

Queue-discipline: "first come, first served." Service-mechanism: a general number, s, of servers; negative-exponential service-times. If Q is the number of people waiting at an instant just preceding the arrival of a new customer, and if w is the waiting time of an arbitrary customer, then it will be shown that the equilibrium distribution of Q is a geometric series mixed with a concentration at Q = 0 and that the equilibrium distribution of w is a negative-exponential distribution mixed with a concentration at w = 0. (In the particular case of a single server this property of the waiting-time distribution was first discovered by W. L. Smith.)

The plan representations which have emerged have been found to be of benefit in a number of areas even when plan generation is not a primary concern. The author addresses the use of AI plan representations in business process modelling. Knowledge based systems can be used to provide support to organisations to capture and model their current processes using enriched knowledge/process representations. This leads to a basis for enhanced analyses and re-engineering aids to improve the business processes},

  abstract = {This article is concerned with the representation and generalisation of continuous action spaces in reinforcement learning (RL) problems. A model is proposed based on the self-organising map (SOM) of Kohonen [Self Organisation and Associative Memory, 1987] which allows either the one-to-one, many-to-one or one-to-many structure of the desired state–action mapping to be captured. Although presented here for tasks involving immediate reward, the approach is easily extended to delayed reward. We conclude that the \{SOM\} is a useful tool for providing real-time, on-line generalisation in \{RL\} problems in which the latent dimensionalities of the state and action spaces are small. Scalability issues are also discussed.},
